# Scene-Adaptive-Denoiser
Scene-Adaptive-Denoiser: A unified framework for infrared impulse noise removal. It replaces binary detection with a continuous, saliency-guided soft fusion strategy. By integrating thermal target priors, structure consistency, and global scene modulation, it robustly protects hot targets while cleaning background noise.
